# Face Mask Sales Management Website
## Introduction
Woolin Auto is an automobile manufacturer based in China. During the COVID-19 
period, the company decides to open a product line of face mask manufacturing, in 
order to mitigate the big gap between the demand and supply both inside and outside 
China. Recently, as the COVID-19 becomes pandemic abroad, the company would like 
to setup a business sector that is responsible of overseas sales of the produced face
masks. The manager of the sector would like to adopt a face mask Sales Management 
System (SMS) to ease the management process. As one of the talented IT specialists 
in Woolin Auto, you are the one chosen to design and implement this SMS. Apart from 
that, if you copy any code from others or let someone else develop this SMS, the 
manager will be disappointed and immediately report this to me. Plagiarism leads to 
a zero mark for this coursework.

The manager asked you to build a website that provides the following basic 
functionalities:
1. Allow customers to order face masks or cancel the orderings.
2. Allow sales representatives (reps) to check and operate his/her sales.
3. Allow the manager to perform admin tasks and check the sale statistics
